Task-2 Prediction using Unsupervised ML
By- Allada Sai Vamsi
Task: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

Task completed during Data Science & Analytics Internship @ The Sparks Foundation.

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. It is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances.
